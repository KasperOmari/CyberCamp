# Home Server Monitoring
This vulnerable application is what I use to monitor my Raspberry Pi at home, I know it's vulnerable, but let's see how!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

> Credits to @0xb11a1 for creating this app.
